# ReactJS Challenge (Edfora)

## UI

The started file has ‘productData’ json imported for you. You have to use a stateful function or a class to create a product grid that shows the product image (first image in the images array), the name of the product, and the price of the product.

(Optional) - On bigger screens, this grid should show three product in a row and on smaller ones, two products in a row. The UI can be bare-bones or look like your favorite e-commerce app.

## Functionality

Create a toggle (a checkbox or a button) that hides or shows out of stock products. Out of stock products have “is_in_stock” value 0.

Create a text field to search product based on title and only render the products that match the input. Bonus points for making it a live search (i.e without any submit button) and a trivial fuzzy search.

> **Note:** Although these tasks can all be done with vanilla JS and React; if you so choose, you can use the ‘add dependency’ button to add a third party library.
